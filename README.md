FPM Build scripts
-----------------
Currently a series of scripts to build various packages into distro native package formats using [Jordan Sissel's AWESOME fpm](https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm)

Think of it as ghetto homebrew for Linux distros

Please, please, please fork and add more. 


TODO/Ideas
----------
* JSON build descriptor file or just standard Makefiles?
